### Executive Summary
In this lab, we had to define and explain various hardware components as well as their purposes. Starting off in the hardware section, we first learn about the different types of hard drives and memory for computers. We learn about the control unit and ALU inside computers, as well as how the CPU, input, and output work. In order to understand binary code, you must learn decimal, binary, and hexadecimal numbers and how to solve for and convert them. Last but not least, we learn about hexademical color representation, and which colors would or wouldn't be problematic with web accessibility. 

### Hardware
##### Hard Drives and Memory
In the performance of a hard drive, both latency and transfer rates are major factors, yet both are different. Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a completed seek, while a transfer rate is the speed data is transferred to and from the disk media and is a function of the recording frequency. While latency is measured in milliseconds, transfer rates are measured in megabytes per second. 

When dealing with computers, not all hard drives are going to be the same, and 2 examples of hard drives that are different are solid state hard drives and traditional hard drives. For starters, solid state drives have a faster speed of operation than traditional hard drives. Unlike traditional hard drives, the information on solid state hard drives can be accessed immediately. Solid state hard drives also have greater stability over traditional hard drives.

Increasing RAM makes the computer run faster because it allows more data to be loaded onto the computer as well as better performance. 64 bit data paths transfer 64 bits at a time, while 32 bit data paths transfer 32 bits at a time.

##### ALU and the Control Unit
The control unit receives instructions from RAM and tells the ALU what type of operation to perform. The ALU performs the operation and outputs the answer. Depending on the type of instruction, the output from the ALU can be ignored. For example, if there is a compare instruction, the ALU doesn't need to output an answer, and uses flags to help the control unit decide what to do when it receives the next instruction.

##### CPU, Input & Output
The input, CPU, and output are addressed in the following way: Computers take many different types of input, for example, a keyboard of a computer, the touch pad of a phone, etc. Sensors on a car, thermostat, or drone are input devices as well. When keys on a keyboard are pressed, they are sent in as binary and the CPU calculates how to display the keys pixel-by-pixel. The CPU requests step-by-step instructions from memory which tells how to draw the key, the example used being the letter B. Then it runs these instructions and stores the results as pixels in its memory. The pixel information is then sent in binary to the screen, which is an output device that converts the binary signals into the tiny lights and colors that make up what you see.

##### Logic Gates and Circuits
The definition of a truth table is a table that shows the output you get (one or zero) for every possible input. Truth tables summarize how logic gates work. The main gate being discussed today is a NAND gate. A NAND gate is exactly the same as an AND gate, except that their outputs are reversed. For example, if the outputs of an AND gate are 0, 0, 0, and 1, the amount of zeros and ones will be reversed for the outputs of a NAND gate, making the NAND gate's outputs be 1, 1, 1, and 0.

##### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
IEEE is the world's largest technical professional society and is an association that advances innovation and technological excellence to benefit humanity. IEEE stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and they use the innovations of the practitioners they represent to enhance their excellence in delivering products and services to members, industries, and the public at large. When it comes to device design, ethics plays a very important role. From the beginning of its creation, ethics has been embedded in the design and development process for AI. When developing AI, everybody must know the ethical resources and standards available for reference.

### Data Representation
##### Numeric Conversions
Decimal numbers represent any number using 10 digits from 0-9, binary numbers represent any numbers using 2 digits from 0-1, and hexadecimal numbers represent any number using 10 digits and 6 characters, being 0-9 and A-F.

##### Hexadecimal Color Representation 
In a RGB color space, hex #ab00ff is composed of 67.1% red, 0% green and 100% blue. Whereas in a CMYK color space, it is composed of 32.9% cyan, 100% magenta, 0% yellow and 0% black. It has a hue angle of 280.2 degrees, a saturation of 100% and a lightness of 50%. #ab00ff color hex could be obtained by blending #ff00ff with #5700ff. Closest websafe color is: #9900ff.

I do not believe that this color would be problematic with web accessibility. The minimum standard for regular sized text is a contrast ratio of 4.5:1. The precise contrast of #ab00ff is 3.34, which passes AA for large text. It is recommended by W3C to start at 18pt regular weight or 14pt bold text, and #ab00ff meets this recommendation.

### Conclusion
I will definitely say that this lab felt more time-consuming than the previous one. It was worth doing because I learned many new things I wasn't aware of before. I learned how to differentiate between different types of hard drives, as well as how keys are transferred onto a computer with binary code. I learned the difference between the three types of numbers as well as how to convert them to each other, skills which will greatly help me in this field. I wasn't previously aware that different colors cause web accessibility problems with colorblind people, but after reading about it, it made a lot of sense and was a very interesting fact. I'm always interested in learning more about how computers work, and this lab helped teach me a lot. I already want to learn more about how computers run and work given everything I just learned and practiced in this lab.
