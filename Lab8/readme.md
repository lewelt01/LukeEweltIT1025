### Executive Summary
The first part of this lab focuses on data, information, and knowledge. This part of the lab only had writing involved, but tables as well as primary and foreign keys. Importantly, we also learn about big data, the four Vs of big data, and types of technology that have increased the need for big data. The second part of this lab focuses on Structured Query Language. We learn about SQL and get to create SQL statements to gain an understanding of how they work, as well as about SQL injections and how to reduce issues surrounding those. The final part of the lab focuses on ethical and legal implications of information systems. Like the first part of the lab, this is a writing only one. We learn about codes of ethics and acceptable use policies as well as about WIPO and how a copyright is obtained. 

### Data, Information and Knowledge

##### Relational Data
i. Data are the raw facts, and may be devoid of context or intent; information is processed data that possess context, relevance, and purpose; and knowledge  in a certain area is human beliefs or perceptions about relationships among facts or concepts relevant to that area.

ii. 1. The primary key in the customers table would be the name of the customer, and the primary key in the orders table would be the product ordered. 2. The customers and orders tables would be related because the customer is the one who orders the product. 3. The foreign key in the orders table would be the customer ID. 

iii. It is important to properly define the data type of a field because each field has a unique structure that is different from all the other fields, and every field must be differentiated from the other ones.

##### Big Data
i.  The four Vs of big data are the following: 1. Volume: the amount of data and one of the main characteristics that makes data “big”; 2. Velocity: The motion of the data; 3. Variety: defines different types of data and data resources; and 4. Veracity: the trustworthiness of the data i.e. calculation of the noises, biases and abnormality in the data.

ii. Types of technology that have driven the increased need for big data include cricket websites, retail and e-commerce industries, and file systems.

### Structured Query Language 
a. Relational Database Management System (RDMS) is the basis for SQL, which is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

b. The two tables I've picked are Order Details and Products. The Primary key for both of them is "ProductID," and the foreign key is "OrderID." The relationship between the two tables is that the order details describe the products in question, as well as its quantity and prices.

### SQL Injections
SQL Injections are a security threat for several reasons. An SQL Injection tends to occur after asking a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, you are given an SQL statement that will unknowingly be run on the database. For example, by simply inserting 105 OR 1=1 into the input field, hackers could potentially gain access to all the user names and passwords in a database. SQL Parameters can be used to protect a website from SQL Injection. Each parameter is checked by the SLQ injection to ensure that it is correct for its column and are treated literally, and not as part of the SQL to be executed.

### Ethical and Legal Implications

##### Code of Ethics
i. A Code of Ethics is a document agreed to by all members of a group that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group. The ACM created a code for computer discipline to establish personal responsibility, as well as to respect the privacy of each member, prevent bullying of coworkers, and to ensure computer systems enhance the quality of life.

ii. The difference between a code of ethics and an acceptable use policy is that an AUP is not as specific in its rules as a code of ethics is.

iii. The Website I picked was Reddit. The policy of interest I found is the following: "Rule 1: Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned." https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy#:~:text=Everyone%20has%20a%20right%20to,or%20vulnerability%20will%20be%20banned.&text=Abide%20by%20community%20rules.

##### Intellectual Property
i. WIPO is a self-funding agency of the United Nations that helps governments, businesses and society realize the benefits of IP. They are the global forum for intellectual property (IP) services, policy, information and cooperation.

ii. A copyright is obtained automatically without the need for registration or other formalities. By registering with the U.S. Copyright office, your works are automatically protect under U.S. copyright laws. It would be important to copyright my SVG image so other people wouldn't steal the image and pass it off as their own.

iii. If my svg image became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, a trademark would distinguish my product or company from those of other products or companies.

##### Information Collection
Coppa prevents collection of online data from persons under 13 years of age, FERPA prevents disclosure of information on grades or behavior to anyone other than the student or parent, and HIPAA gives parents rights to their student’s information, and governs how school health services share their data.

### Conclusion
This being the final lab of the class, while still time consuming, I found it to be not as hard as some of the previous ones. The second part of the lab I found to be more challenging than the first and third parts. I got a little confused at first on how to write an SQL statement, but eventually I got the hang of it and did it correctly. The first and third parts were both easier as there was only writing involved and no mini projects or screenshots. As in every other lab, I learned a lot in this one. I learned so much in this whole class, and I would say that this class was a very educational and insightful class that I took this semester.
