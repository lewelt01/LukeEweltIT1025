### Executive Summary

### Data, Information and Knowledge

##### Relational Data
i. Data are the raw facts, and may be devoid of context or intent; information is processed data that possess context, relevance, and purpose; and knowledge  in a certain area is human beliefs or perceptions about relationships among facts or concepts relevant to that area.

ii. 1. The primary key in the customers table would be the name of the customer, and the primary key in the orders table would be the product ordered. 2. The customers and orders tables would be related because the customer is the one who orders the product. 3. The foreign key in the orders table would be the customer ID. 

iii. It is important to properly define the data type of a field because each field has a unique structure that is different from all the other fields, and every field must be differentiated from the other ones.

##### Big Data
i.  The four Vs of big data are the following: 1. Volume: the amount of data and one of the main characteristics that makes data “big”; 2. Velocity: The motion of the data; 3. Variety: defines different types of data and data resources; and 4. Veracity: the trustworthiness of the data i.e. calculation of the noises, biases and abnormality in the data.

ii. Types of technology that have driven the increased need for big data include cricket websites, retail and e-commerce industries, and file systems.

### Structured Query Language 
a. Relational Database Management System (RDMS) is the basis for SQL, which is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.

b. The two tables I've picked are Order Details and Products. The Primary key for both of them is "ProductID," and the foreign key is "OrderID." The relationship between the two tables is that the order details describe the products in question, as well as its quantity and prices.
