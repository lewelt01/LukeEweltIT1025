### Executive Summary

### Internet Architecture

##### Internet Protocol
An IP address is the numbers assigned to a computer network interface. IPv4 addresses are shorter strings of numbers than are IPv6 addresses.

ICANN is the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions, and allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) around the world.

##### TCP/IP
a. TCP/IP is a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware.

b. The client-server model in a TCP/IP connection involves the Client, the computer or device that “dials the phone," and the server, the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in.

c. Layers are important to changing technology mainly because any of the layers/tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers.

Applications that run on the application layer are SMTP, FTP, HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, and SNMP.

##### Internet Security
Hyper Transfer Text Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that is used for viewing web pages on the internet, and all information is sent in clear text.

Secure HTTP uses Secure Sockets (SSL), which uses public key encryption to ensure data, and Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor to SSL which authenticates the server, client, and encrypts the data.

##### Securing Your Web Browser
a. You should secure your browser because web browsers are used so frequently and to avoid having your computer hacked.

b. One risk described is cookies, files placed on your system to store data for specific websites. When a website uses cookies, an attacker may be able to acquire unauthorized access to that site by obtaining the cookie.

### Internet Programming

##### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the world wide web, and he created the W3C to develop interoperable technologies to lead the Web to its full potential.

The standard I will discuss is Web Design and Applications. Web Designs and Applications is important because it involves the standards for building and Rendering Web pages, which includes HTML, CSS, SVG, device APIs, and other technologies for Web Applications.

##### HTML5 and CSS
HTML5 is used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. CSS is used to format the layout of a webpage. For my webpage, I mainly relied on the tutorials which I would say greatly benefitted me and helped me through how to properly make it. It was confusing at first, but I managed to get the hang of it after reading what the different codes meant and practicing with the tutorials.

##### HTML and XML
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages, while XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data. XML was designed to carry data with focus on what data is, while HTML was designed to display data with focus on how data looks. Unlike HTML tags, XML tags are not predefined.
