### Executive Summary

### Internet Architecture

##### Internet Protocol
An IP address is the numbers assigned to a computer network interface. IPv4 addresses are shorter strings of numbers than are IPv6 addresses.

ICANN is the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions, and allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) around the world.

##### TCP/IP
a. TCP/IP is a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware.

b. The client-server model in a TCP/IP connection involves the Client, the computer or device that “dials the phone," and the server, the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in.

c. Layers are important to changing technology mainly because any of the layers/tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers.

Applications that run on the application layer are SMTP, FTP, HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, and SNMP.

##### Internet Security
Hyper Transfer Text Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that is used for viewing web pages on the internet, and all information is sent in clear text.

Secure HTTP uses Secure Sockets (SSL), which uses public key encryption to ensure data, and Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor to SSL which authenticates the server, client, and encrypts the data.

##### Securing Your Web Browser
a. You should secure your browser because web browsers are used so frequently and to avoid having your computer hacked.

b. One risk described is cookies, files placed on your system to store data for specific websites. When a website uses cookies, an attacker may be able to acquire unauthorized access to that site by obtaining the cookie.
