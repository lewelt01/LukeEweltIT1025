### Executive Summary
The first part of this lab focuses on Internet Architecture. First we learn the definition of an IP address as well as the client/server model. The TCP/IP section teaches that there are different layers containing different applications running on the computer. We then learn about HTTP, which protects data, and the importance of securing your browser and the risks associated if you don't. The second part of this lab focuses on Internet Programming. We learn about Tim Berners-lee, the inventer of the World Wide Web, and we get to create our own webpage based on a subject of our choosing. The third and final part of the lab focuses on URLs and File Paths. First we have to define and match terms pertaining to a URL. After making an images folder and finding an image, we have to insert an image into our webpage. This lab will greatly increase our knowledge and understanding of internet architecture and programming.

### Internet Architecture

##### Internet Protocol
An IP address is the numbers assigned to a computer network interface. IPv4 addresses are shorter strings of numbers than are IPv6 addresses.

ICANN is the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions, and allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) around the world.

##### TCP/IP
a. TCP/IP is a network protocol that defines the details of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware.

b. The client-server model in a TCP/IP connection involves the Client, the computer or device that “dials the phone," and the server, the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in.

c. Layers are important to changing technology mainly because any of the layers/tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers.

Applications that run on the application layer are SMTP, FTP, HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, and SNMP.

##### Internet Security
Hyper Transfer Text Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol that is used for viewing web pages on the internet, and all information is sent in clear text.

Secure HTTP uses Secure Sockets (SSL), which uses public key encryption to ensure data, and Transport Layer Security (TLS), the successor to SSL which authenticates the server, client, and encrypts the data.

##### Securing Your Web Browser
a. You should secure your browser because web browsers are used so frequently and to avoid having your computer hacked.

b. One risk described is cookies, files placed on your system to store data for specific websites. When a website uses cookies, an attacker may be able to acquire unauthorized access to that site by obtaining the cookie.

### Internet Programming

##### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the world wide web, and he created the W3C to develop interoperable technologies to lead the Web to its full potential.

The standard I will discuss is Web Design and Applications. Web Designs and Applications is important because it involves the standards for building and Rendering Web pages, which includes HTML, CSS, SVG, device APIs, and other technologies for Web Applications.

##### HTML5 and CSS
HTML5 is used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. CSS is used to format the layout of a webpage. For my webpage, I mainly relied on the tutorials which I would say greatly benefitted me and helped me through how to properly make it. It was confusing at first, but I managed to get the hang of it after reading what the different codes meant and practicing with the tutorials.

##### HTML and XML
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages, while XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data. XML was designed to carry data with focus on what data is, while HTML was designed to display data with focus on how data looks. Unlike HTML tags, XML tags are not predefined.

### Components of a URL
Scheme: https; tells the browser what type of address it is so the browser connects to it correctly.

Domain: Each segment of the domain name separated by a period; no file path provided

Top Level Domain: The domain on the right; .edu

Default Page: The page that helps you navigate other pages; www.amazon.com

Parameters: a string of characters after the path that begin with a question mark; result of search

Anchor: Tells your browser to scroll to or load a specific part of the page; specific location on a page.

### Conclusion
Overall, this was a very interesting and knowledgeable lab. While learning about IP addresses and HTTP was fun, the most fun part was definitely creating the webpage. It was confusing at first, especially with the coding, but I managed to get the hang of it and create it correctly. It was also very fun creating the different themes for the page, and I especially liked adding the image to it. Besides the webpage, I also enjoyed learning about the creator of the world wide web, and found him and its history to be very interesting. Like every lab, this lab taught me a lot about the interent and coding, and I am excited to learn more new things in the next labs I do.
