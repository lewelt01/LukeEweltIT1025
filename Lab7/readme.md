### Executive Summary
The first part of this lab involves file and folder compression. After explaining file compression, you have to access your svg file from the previous lab and then compress it. Then you have to explain the difference between the file sizes of JPG files and SVG files. Finally, you have to compress your IT1025YourName folder then upload it to your lab folder. The second part of this lab deals again with Python, and we learn about classes and objects in programming. You have to go onto Python IDLE and create the program in the tutorial, and after adding a third shark with your name, screenshot the program and program run then upload it to your lab folder. In the third and final part of this lab, we learn about object oriented concepts, and after first matching terms, we go onto LucidChart and create a class diagram as a template for our shark class. Finally, we download the file as a JPG and upload it to our lab folder.

### File Compression

a. File Compression allows people to make one or more files into a smaller zip file. After the file is compressed, the new file takes up 50% to 90% less disk space than the original file.

b. Unlike a JPG, an SVG can be changed in size and always retain its original quality. If the file were a JPG and you tried to change the size, there would be a loss in quality and the picture would become stretched out or blurry. SVG files are ideal for logos, icons, and simple graphics, and since they're smaller in size, they won't slow down a website at all.

### Python OOP

a. The methods of a shark class are "swim()" and "be_awesome()." They are called using a dot operator, which references an attribute of an object.

b. The purpose of a constructor is to initialize data.

c. A class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object, while an object is an instance of a class. To instantiate an object from a class is to define said object.

### Object Oriented Concepts

i. When going through a drive-thru, an example of a class would be the dollar menu, and the objects created from the class would be the food in the dollar menu.

ii. Object: Sammy; Sammy is the object created in the program. Class: Shark; Shark is the name of the class. Abstraction: Definition of a shark; Abstraction defines all the components. Inheritance: A specific type of shark: An inheritance is basing a class or object upon another object or class while retaining similar implementation. Encapsulation: swim(self); Encapsulation is the bundling of data.

### Conclusion
Overall, this was the shortest lab I had to complete in a long time. I found it interesting learning about file compression and getting to revisit and compress my logo I made for the previous lab. It was cool learning about classes and objects, especially how the programs work. It was a lot of fun getting to make my own program, and I liked getting to go back to working on LucidChart as I had a lot of fun doing it before. Although this lab was less time consuming overall, I learned a lot of new things especially about coding and programming. In my field, it will be important to understand programming, and I feel that this lab was one of many that will give me a head start in the skills necessary for my future career.
