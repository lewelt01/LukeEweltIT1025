### Executive Summary

### File Compression

a. File Compression allows people to make one or more files into a smaller zip file. After the file is compressed, the new file takes up 50% to 90% less disk space than the original file.

b. Unlike a JPG, an SVG can be changed in size and always retain its original quality. If the file were a JPG and you tried to change the size, there would be a loss in quality and the picture would become stretched out or blurry. SVG files are ideal for logos, icons, and simple graphics, and since they're smaller in size, they won't slow down a website at all.

### Python OOP

a. The methods of a shark class are "swim()" and "be_awesome()." They are called using a dot operator, which references an attribute of an object.

b. The purpose of a constructor is to initialize data.

c. A class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object, while an object is an instance of a class. To instantiate an object from a class is to define said object.
