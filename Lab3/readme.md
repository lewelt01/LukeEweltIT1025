### Executive Summary
In this lab, the main purpose was to explore careers in information technology and to define sofware types and pratice working with virtualization and Python. We learn the roles of application, utility and operating system software, as well as the difference between cloud computing and virtualization. Then we learn how to use Python, and we get to go the website where we can type in words and practice coding them. Finally, we learn about career exploration and exploring what careers are right for you. There's a vast selection of different jobs, internships, programs, and careers you can scroll through and potentially find ones you are interested in. The lab teaches you more about coding and about the vast selection of jobs there are in the Information Technology field.

### Software
The application software performs tasks like word processing, accounting, database management, video games, or browsing the web. An example of application software is a killer application, one that becomes so essential that large numbers of people will buy a device just to run that application.
Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way. One example of utility software is anti-malware.
Programming sofware produces software. An example of programming sofware is programming language.

ERP (Enterprise Research Planning) software utilizes a central database that is implemented throughout an entire organization, and is an application used by many of said orgaization's employees. ERP utilizes a central data base, and is implemented worldwide. Examples of ERP systems include ones from SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft.

Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based, or virtual, representation of something, such as virtual applications, servers, storage and networks. It most effectively reduces IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility for all size businesses. Using software, virtualization simulates hardware functionality and creates a virtual computer system, enabling IT organizations to run multiple virtual and operating systems and applications on a single server.

### Virtualization
There are many types of problems solved with Virtualization. Initially, most enterprises had physical servers and single-vendor IT stacks, and these didn’t allow legacy apps to run on a different vendor’s hardware. When virtualization took off, companies were then able to partition their servers and run legacy apps on multiple operating system types and versions. Servers started being used more efficienly, reducing the costs associated with purchase, set up, cooling, and maintenance.

In virtualization, hypervisors create and run virtual machines, separating the physical resources from the virtual environments.

There is a major difference between cloud computing and virtualization. Virtualization is technology used to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from one physical hardware system, while cloud computing is a set of principles and approaches used to deliver compute, network, and storage infrastructure resources, services, platforms, and applications to users on-demand across any network. However, when you're bound to a vendor’s enterprise-license agreement, it may limit your ability to invest in modern technologies like clouds, containers, and automation systems.

As many may wonder, it is very possible to transfer from virtualization to cloud computing. In order to switch from a virtual infrastructure, create a cloud by pooling virtual resources together, and orchestrate them using management and automation software, then create a self-service portal for users.

### Python
The pseudo-code nature of Python is that it is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a Python program feels almost like reading a more strict English, allowing you to concentrate on the solution instead of the language itself.

A compiled language is converted from the source language into a language spoken by a computer using a compiler with various flags and options. When the program runs, the linker/loader software copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it. With interpreted language, such as Python, you just run the program directly from the source code, and does not need compilation to binary.

### Career Exploration
On the Bureau of Labor Statistics website, I looked under Occupation Finder and looked for jobs with an Associate's Degree, which is what I am currently trying to get in college. Surprisingly there were only 46 entries, and these lack of entries show me that when going through college, I need to have more than just an Associate's Degree to have a wide range of successful job opportunities.

##### College Central
College central has a vast collection of career oppurtunities. When searching through Jobs Central, with just the click of a button, over 2500 jobs came up that met my criteria. This is the same case with Intern Central. While only 100 jobs came up in this, they were still all mostly jobs involving computers and technology, and these jobs also met my criteria. This website is also helpful in the fact that it can help me build a resume as well as a career portfolio. When searching for a new job, College Central is a website that can really help you find the job that's right for you.

##### Certifications
The certification I picked was CompTIA. CompTIA applies behavioral analytics to networks and devices to prevent, detect and combat cybersecurity threats through continuous security monitoring. The end goal of the exam is to secure and protect the applications and systems within an organization. Jobs that use CompTIA include Security Analyst, Security Engineer, Threat intelligence analyst, Application security analyst, Incident response or handler, Compliance analyst, and Threat hunter.

##### Certficates
Digital marketing using devices or the Internet for your marketing efforts. Tri-C offers many different digital marketing courses. Under the programs and certifications section on the website, they talk about a digital marketing boot camp. It is 5 weeks long, and covers all aspects of digital marketing, including social media, digital marketing strategy, campaign planning, content development, lead generation and engaging customers via mobile and email campaigns. There are many specialty courses with certifications as well that you can take for digital marketing.

##### Co-ops/Internships
In order to become co-op ready, you must do many steps, like you must participate in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center,
upload your resume for final revisions and approval by a Career Coach at Handshake,
work with an Employer Relations Specialist to apply and interview with approved co-op placements, and
complete and sign a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form and register for college credit. The benefits of pursuing an internship is that is provides a student the opportunity to explore areas of interest, as well as integrating academic study with work experience.

##### Industry Associations/Student Organizations
The Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) system provids institutions with an information assurance or computer security curriculum a controlled, competitive environment. This environment assesses their student's depth of understanding and operational competency in managing the challenges built into protecting a corporate network infrastructure and business information systems. Membership in the CCDC would be beneficial for many reasons. Students will be able to apply the theory and practical skills they have learned in their course work, as well as foster a spirit of teamwork, ethical behavior, and effective communication both within and across teams.

### Conclusion
When I first viewed this lab, I had no clue how time consuming this would be. I learned a lot about software, as well as virtualization and cloud computing, which I didn't even know what those fully were before I started this. When practicing with Python, I got to practice with and learn more about computer coding, which was a fun experience. In the career exploration section, I learned a lot more about the vast selection of jobs there are out there in the IT field, and that for my career I need to keep my options wide open as there are so many out there. In finishing the lab, I feel that I am now better able to define the software types, understand computer coding better, and how to explore career options in my field. There's so much I still need to learn, but I'm learning more everytime with each lab I do.
