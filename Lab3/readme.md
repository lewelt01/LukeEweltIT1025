### Executive Summary

### Software
The application software performs tasks like word processing, accounting, database management, video games, or browsing the web. An example of application software is a killer application, one that becomes so essential that large numbers of people will buy a device just to run that application.
Utility software includes programs that allow you to fix or modify your computer in some way. One example of utility software is anti-malware.
Programming sofware produces software. An example of programming sofware is programming language.

ERP (Enterprise Research Planning) software utilizes a central database that is implemented throughout an entire organization, and is an application used by many of said orgaization's employees. ERP utilizes a central data base, and is implemented worldwide. Examples of ERP systems include ones from SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft.

Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based, or virtual, representation of something, such as virtual applications, servers, storage and networks. It most effectively reduces IT expenses while boosting efficiency and agility for all size businesses. Using software, virtualization simulates hardware functionality and creates a virtual computer system, enabling IT organizations to run multiple virtual and operating systems and applications on a single server.

### Virtualization
There are many types of problems solved with Virtualization. Initially, most enterprises had physical servers and single-vendor IT stacks, and these didn’t allow legacy apps to run on a different vendor’s hardware. When virtualization took off, companies were then able to partition their servers and run legacy apps on multiple operating system types and versions. Servers started being used more efficienly, reducing the costs associated with purchase, set up, cooling, and maintenance.

In virtualization, hypervisors create and run virtual machines, separating the physical resources from the virtual environments.

There is a major difference between cloud computing and virtualization. Virtualization is technology used to create multiple simulated environments or dedicated resources from one physical hardware system, while cloud computing is a set of principles and approaches used to deliver compute, network, and storage infrastructure resources, services, platforms, and applications to users on-demand across any network. However, when you're bound to a vendor’s enterprise-license agreement, it may limit your ability to invest in modern technologies like clouds, containers, and automation systems.

As many may wonder, it is very possible to transfer from virtualization to cloud computing. In order to switch from a virtual infrastructure, create a cloud by pooling virtual resources together, and orchestrate them using management and automation software, then create a self-service portal for users.

### Python
The pseudo-code nature of Python is that it is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a Python program feels almost like reading a more strict English, allowing you to concentrate on the solution instead of the language itself.

A compiled language is converted from the source language into a language spoken by a computer using a compiler with various flags and options. When the program runs, the linker/loader software copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it. With interpreted language, such as Python, you just run the program directly from the source code, and does not need compilation to binary.
