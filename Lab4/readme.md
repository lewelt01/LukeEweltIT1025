### Executive Summary
The first part of this lab focuses on Operating Systems. It gives you practice with coding, and it helps you learn commands and how to create directories. During these excercises, you must take screenshots of the codings and upload them into your GitHub folder. The second part involves practice with the software Python. In Python you have to create an application saying hello to yourself, and then explain many definitions of things involved in coding. The third part of the lab introduces you to graphics and is the most fun part, as you get to create your own logo for a company on a website called Vectr.

### Python IDLE
In the IDLE, the shell editor has the >>> prompt, while the file editor does not have this prompt. The shell editor runs Python intructions as soon as you press ENTER, while the file editor let's you type in many instructions, save the file, and run the program.

##### Code Examples
i. A variable in coding is like a box that can store a single value. An example of a variable is spam. The author uses the variable names spam, bacon, and eggs because they are often used in Python tutorials because of the spam comedy sketch from Monty Python.

ii. An assignment statement creates new variables and stores the values inside of them. An example of an assignment statement, as shown in the video, is "spam = 42."

iii. A function in coding is a group of statements that perform specific tasks. An example of a function is the print function, which displays the string value inside the parentheses on the screen.

iv. The three data types are integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. Examples of integers are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Examples of floating-point numbers are -1.25, -1.0, --0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.25. Examples of strings are 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!', and '11 cats'.

### Graphics

##### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
A Raster image is one that is small and loses quality when you enlarge them. Unlike Raster images, Vector images can be made any size, big or small, without losing quality. A Raster image would be appropriate, for example, for non-line art images. Vector images are primarly used for printing.

##### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossless image compression is when all the data from the original file is preserved, while Lossy Compression removes some data from the original file and saves the image with a reduced file size. Different types of images and files prefer one format over the other. Depending on the quality of the image, one form of compression must be used. For example, in printing, lossy image compression should be completely avoided because print graphics aren't as forgiving of artifacting and low image quality than on-screen graphics are.

##### File Formats
JPGs are compress image data by reducing sections of images to blocks of pixels, and as soon as they are saved they are permanent and cannot be edited any further. A GIF is an older filetype like a JPG, and is more associated to the internet instead of photography. PNGs are for internet graphics, and supports transparency in browsers with an elegance that GIF does not possess. Initially developed as an alternative to GIF, it supports 8-bit color like GIF, as well as 24-bit color RGB like JPG.

##### File Properties
i. My image design is for a Carwash, as shown in the title: "Doggy See Doggy Clean Carwash." I believe 2 layers were used for it, and the first layer of all the blue circles represents bubbles, while the second layer is the dog mascot and the title of the company.

ii. The file size is 358 KB (367,427 bytes), and it opens with Google Chrome. An application that may be more appropriate for it is Paint, as with Paint, you could draw on and edit the logo to make alterations and additions to it.

### Conclusion
Overall, I learned a ton of new things in this lab today, and overcame many of the obstacles involved in completing it. The first part of the lab felt like more of a challenge. Typing in the commands felt complicated and at times I wasn't sure if I was doing it right. I wasn't sure at first how to create a directory, but in the end I was able to get it all down. The second part involving Python also felt like a challenge, and I got a bit confused with the Hello application and if I was doing that correctly. I did find interesting, however, the videos explaining Python and all of the definitions going along with it. The third and final part of the lab was the most fun for me. I found it interesting learning about graphics and the different types of file formats. Creating a logo was actually awesome, and it was fun having art involved. I feel that my logo was very clever, and this lab taught me a lot more about coding and graphics, which will greatly help me in future lessons.
