### Executive Summary

### Python IDLE
In the IDLE, the shell editor has the >>> prompt, while the file editor does not have this prompt. The shell editor runs Python intructions as soon as you press ENTER, while the file editor let's you type in many instructions, save the file, and run the program.

##### Code Examples
i. A variable in coding is like a box that can store a single value. An example of a variable is spam. The author uses the variable names spam, bacon, and eggs because they are often used in Python tutorials because of the spam comedy sketch from Monty Python.

ii. An assignment statement creates new variables and stores the values inside of them. An example of an assignment statement, as shown in the video, is "spam = 42."

iii. A function in coding is a group of statements that perform specific tasks. An example of a function is the print function, which displays the string value inside the parentheses on the screen.

iv. The three data types are integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. Examples of integers are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Examples of floating-point numbers are -1.25, -1.0, --0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.25. Examples of strings are 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!', and '11 cats'.

### Graphics

##### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
A Raster image is one that is small and loses quality when you enlarge them. Unlike Raster images, Vector images can be made any size, big or small, without losing quality. A Raster image would be appropriate, for example, for non-line art images. Vector images are primarly used for printing.

##### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Lossless image compression is when all the data from the original file is preserved, while Lossy Compression removes some data from the original file and saves the image with a reduced file size. Different types of images and files prefer one format over the other. Depending on the quality of the image, one form of compression must be used. For example, in printing, lossy image compression should be completely avoided because print graphics aren't as forgiving of artifacting and low image quality than on-screen graphics are.

##### File Formats
JPGs are compress image data by reducing sections of images to blocks of pixels, and as soon as they are saved they are permanent and cannot be edited any further. A GIF is an older filetype like a JPG, and is more associated to the internet instead of photography. PNGs are for internet graphics, and supports transparency in browsers with an elegance that GIF does not possess. Initially developed as an alternative to GIF, it supports 8-bit color like GIF, as well as 24-bit color RGB like JPG.
