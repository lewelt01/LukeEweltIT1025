### Executive Summary

### Python IDLE
In the IDLE, the shell editor has the >>> prompt, while the file editor does not have this prompt. The shell editor runs Python intructions as soon as you press ENTER, while the file editor let's you type in many instructions, save the file, and run the program.

##### Code Examples
i. A variable in coding is like a box that can store a single value. An example of a variable is spam. The author uses the variable names spam, bacon, and eggs because they are often used in Python tutorials because of the spam comedy sketch from Monty Python.

ii. An assignment statement creates new variables and stores the values inside of them. An example of an assignment statement, as shown in the video, is "spam = 42."

iii. A function in coding is a group of statements that perform specific tasks. An example of a function is the print function, which displays the string value inside the parentheses on the screen.

iv. The three data types are integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. Examples of integers are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Examples of floating-point numbers are -1.25, -1.0, --0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.25. Examples of strings are 'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!', and '11 cats'.
