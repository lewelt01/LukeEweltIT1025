### Executive Summary

### Lucidchart
All in all, my FlowChart experience was very interesting. The website had a lot of cool features. As I learned, it's really cool learning how to make a flowchart as well as all of the shapes there are. I liked getting to choose the number, and wile I got a little confused as to how to set up the chart, I got the hang of it and was able to do it correctly. Lucidchart was a cool experience and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at first.

### Introduction to Networking

##### Data Transmission

Packet: Unit of data

Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address

IP Address: Unique identifying number

DNS: Directory of IP Address common names

Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

### Network Hardware

The benefit of a switch over a hub is that unlike a hub, a switch is intelligent, and can learn the physical addresses of the devices connected to it. It stores the physical addresses (MAC addresses) in its table. In a switch, data is only directed to the intended destination port, while a hub would rebroadcast data to every port.

The benefit of a router over hubs and switches is that a router is used to connect networks while hubs and switches only create networks.
