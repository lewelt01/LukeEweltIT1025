### Executive Summary

### Lucidchart
All in all, my FlowChart experience was very interesting. The website had a lot of cool features. As I learned, it's really cool learning how to make a flowchart as well as all of the shapes there are. I liked getting to choose the number, and wile I got a little confused as to how to set up the chart, I got the hang of it and was able to do it correctly. Lucidchart was a cool experience and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at first.

### Introduction to Networking

##### Data Transmission

Packet: Unit of data

Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address

IP Address: Unique identifying number

DNS: Directory of IP Address common names

Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

##### Network Hardware

The benefit of a switch over a hub is that unlike a hub, a switch is intelligent, and can learn the physical addresses of the devices connected to it. It stores the physical addresses (MAC addresses) in its table. In a switch, data is only directed to the intended destination port, while a hub would rebroadcast data to every port.

The benefit of a router over hubs and switches is that a router is used to connect networks while hubs and switches only create networks.

##### Network Topologies

In a Topology, the single point of failure would be when if the central hub or switch failed, then all the computers would be affected and the entire network would go down. The topologies that experience this issue are star topologies and ring topologies.

The infrastructure topology uses a combination of wired and wireless devices, while the wireless mesh topology has all of its devices wirelessly interconnected. I believe the infrastructure topology is better because wireless mesh topologies require extra cabling and extra time running through the building, making it more expensive and more time-consuming.

##### Network Design

For my design, I used the infrastructure topology. In my design, The modem is connected to a switch. The switch is connected to 2 computers, as well as to a wireless access point. The wirless access point connects to the printer, which is wireless and can be used for both of the computers.

##### NSA/CSS

When it comes to cybersecurity, the NSA collects and processes foreign signals, helps to understand them, and shares them with U.S. officials and war fighters so they can take action to keep our nation secure.

### Cybersecurity and Encryption

##### Information Systems Security

a. Being a part of the Amazon.com online chat, confidentitality would mean restricting access to those allowed to see the chat, and nobody else is allowed to learn the contents of the messages and what is being discussed. Integrity would involve having to always tell the truth in the chats and make sure the information represents its intended meaning. Availability would mean having to ensure that the information can be accessed and modified by only people authorized to do so in an appropriate timeframe.

b. Three Daily tasks requiring authentication: (1) Something they know, (2) something they have, and (3) something they are. They could be converted to multi-factor identification by combining two or more of the factors listed, making it much more difficult for someone to misrepresent themselves.

c. An Access Control List (ACL) identifies a list of users who have the capability to take specific actions with an information resource such as data files. Their advantage is that they are simple to understand and maintain, but their disadvantage is that each information resource is managed separately, so if a security administrator wanted to add or remove a user to a large set of information resources, it would be quite difficult. Not to mention, they become harder to maintain as the number of users and resources increases. A Role-Based Access Control (RABC) assigns users to roles and then those roles are assigned the access, allowing administrators to manage users and roles separately, simplifying administration and improving security.

d. It starts out with a plaintext message. This message is encrypted with a public key, and the ciphered text is transmitted through the communication channel and received by someone who then uses their private key to decrypt the message and read the plain text.

e. Public Key Cryptography is needed in order to tighten security on something and keep everything secure.

##### Cryptography

b. For my message, I wrote "pineapple", and locked it at the number 15, turning the word into "dwbsoddzs." This encryption turned each letter of the word 14 spots to the right.

c. The message I wrote was "I am inevitable," and my frequency fingerprint appeared to be very low. This would not be different for different languages.

d. A Polyalphabetic cipher is a cipher that uses several different alphabets and disguises your fingerprint.

e. The message I wrote was "God first" and the shift word was "Jesus." Decrypted, the message said "wjk kphna," and encrypted the message said "qtw abbxm."

### Brute-Force
Brute-Force is an attack that tries every encryption key for a cipher. A cryptanalyst guesses every key, decrypts the ciphertext with that key, looks at the output, and then moves on to the next key if they didnâ€™t find the secret message. Because the brute-force technique is so effective against the Caesar cipher, using the Caesar cipher is greatly discouraged when encrypting secret information. Kerckhoff's Principle says that a cipher should still be secure even if everyone knows how the cipher works and someone else has the ciphertext.

### Conclusion
