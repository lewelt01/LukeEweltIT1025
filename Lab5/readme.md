### Executive Summary

### Lucidchart
All in all, my FlowChart experience was very interesting. The website had a lot of cool features. As I learned, it's really cool learning how to make a flowchart as well as all of the shapes there are. I liked getting to choose the number, and wile I got a little confused as to how to set up the chart, I got the hang of it and was able to do it correctly. Lucidchart was a cool experience and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at first.

### Introduction to Networking

##### Data Transmission

Packet: Unit of data

Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address

IP Address: Unique identifying number

DNS: Directory of IP Address common names

Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

##### Network Hardware

The benefit of a switch over a hub is that unlike a hub, a switch is intelligent, and can learn the physical addresses of the devices connected to it. It stores the physical addresses (MAC addresses) in its table. In a switch, data is only directed to the intended destination port, while a hub would rebroadcast data to every port.

The benefit of a router over hubs and switches is that a router is used to connect networks while hubs and switches only create networks.

##### Network Topologies

In a Topology, the single point of failure would be when if the central hub or switch failed, then all the computers would be affected and the entire network would go down. The topologies that experience this issue are star topologies and ring topologies.

The infrastructure topology uses a combination of wired and wireless devices, while the wireless mesh topology has all of its devices wirelessly interconnected. I believe the infrastructure topology is better because wireless mesh topologies require extra cabling and extra time running through the building, making it more expensive and more time-consuming.

##### Network Design

For my design, I used the infrastructure topology. In my design, The modem is connected to a switch. The switch is connected to 2 computers, as well as to a wireless access point. The wirless access point connects to the printer, which is wireless and can be used for both of the computers.

##### NSA/CSS

When it comes to cybersecurity, the NSA collects and processes foreign signals, helps to understand them, and shares them with U.S. officials and war fighters so they can take action to keep our nation secure.
